This week I have tried to plot the diagram of number of dwellings by place.
I have learned groupby function which is for grouping data based on some criteria and then applying operations to those groups.
second, I have learned the kind='bar' argument tells pandas to create a bar chart.
I have learned to using groupby function to sum up the max, min and mean value of each type of dwelling
From set5's exercise, 'trace += koch(t, order - 1, size / 3)': The function calls itself to draw a Koch curve of 'order - 1' and 'size / 3'. This is the first segment of the curve. The trace from this recursive call is appended to the trace string.
But, I still son't know how to draw the image it out.
