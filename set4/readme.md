This week I started doing the open data project by using Pandas, importing the data and loading the data.
my interesting area which I want to analyze is the dwellings type/ trend in Sydney.
I am a Mac user and the dataset I found is an Excel file that includes several tables and it can't be exported as csv file.
I still learned how to sum up the data and look at what this dataset is telling me. the '.iloc' can help me get a similar to a dictionary of the dataset.  
Then using '.plot' and '.hist' to plot the visual diagram.
The range(100) generates numbers from 0 to 99, and pd.Series() converts this range into a Series.  
The head() function, when called on a Series or DataFrame, returns the first 5 elements by default.
'penalty_data. FACE_VALUE < upper_bound' creates a boolean mask that is applied to filter the data.
