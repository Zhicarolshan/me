TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I started doing the open data project by using Pandas, importing the data and loading the data.
my interesting area which I want to analyze is the dwellings type/ trend in Sydney.
I am a Mac user and the dataset I found is an Excel file that includes several tables and it can't be exported as csv file.
I still learned how to sum up the data and look at what this dataset is telling me. the '.iloc' can help me get a similar to a dictionary of the dataset.  
Then using '.plot' and '.hist' to plot the visual diagram.
From this week's exercise 1, I have learned get request is sent using the requests.get() function to retrieve the data.  
 " if response. status_code == 200:" to check whether the server successfully returned a response. A status code of 200 indicates that the request was successful.
