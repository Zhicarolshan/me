This week I continuously analyze the data, I have learned first the dropna() function is used to remove any rows from the DataFrame that contain missing (NaN) values.
second, 'df_cleaned = df.dropna()' mean the cleaned DataFrame is stored in df_cleaned.
Third, '.reset_index()' the index is reset to turn the grouped data back into a regular DataFrame with a simple index, rather than a hierarchical index.
Fourth, 'grouped_df['Number_of_Dwellings'].sum()' calculates the total number of dwellings across all areas.
'plt.xticks(rotation=90)' rotate the x-axis labels by 90 degrees to make them easier to read, especially if they are long.
'plt.show() 'to display the bar plot.
'index=False' ensures that the index of the DataFrame is not written to the Excel file, meaning the Excel file will only contain the data columns without an additional index column.
This week, I have done the quiz which contains the last few weeks' knowledge, but the fast filler still can't work out
