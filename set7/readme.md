This week I have learned 'agg(['count', 'min', 'max', 'mean'])' to allow me to apply multiple aggregation operations to a data frame or a specific column within a data frame.  
Because I want to summarize your data in different ways simultaneously.  
I have learned that the unstack() function in pandas is used to pivot the level of an index of a data frame to the columns.
I use two different regions Newcastle and the central coast in Sydney to compare the different types of dwellings in these two different regions.
last two weeks, I have summed up the data from Newcastle.
This week I start to sum up the data of the central coast.
