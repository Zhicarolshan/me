TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have learned a string, try/expect, 'for' and 'while' loop.
From the exercises, I started to apply Algorithms that Binary searched on the exercise,
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
Also, I have learned how to use the 'for' loop on the guessing game which repeatedly prompts the user until the correct guess is made
This week I started to search for raw datasets which is for the open data project.
But most of the datasets that I find are already sum up, it is hard to find the raw datasets.
