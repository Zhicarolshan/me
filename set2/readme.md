TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have learned some basic Python vocabulary, functions and code in the lecture.
Then we did some Python exercises to understand how code can be applied.        
In exercise 0, I learned how the expression and theory of BODMAS works in Python and also how to convert words to uppercase in Python.       
In exercise 1, I have been taught how the "for...in... "function and the "if..." function works.      
In exercise 2, I corrected the incorrect code and got "MC Hammer".      
Due to exercise 2, I learned how to generate a word array and concatenation array and print that result out.  
In exercise 3, I learned how to apply functions to get what I expect. Use the " for...in" function to get what the shape what I expect
