From set 4's exercise 1, I have learned get request is sent using the requests.get() function to retrieve the data.  
 " if response. status_code == 200:" to check whether the server successfully returned a response.
A status code of 200 indicates that the request was successful.
From set 4's IO examples, I have learned using debugger to see each lines will done in python
This week, I start to understanding what my data can tell me.
